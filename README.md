# Codes to compute functional connectivity using coherence potentials in EEG
The code extracts positive and negative amplitude deflections termed as coherence potentials from EEG data using a threshold based on standard deviation. It then computes correlations betwwen these coherence potentials and clusters them based on a disance threshold. Various measures of connectivity are then derived based on the clusters of coherence potentials.
